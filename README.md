# NetCache
Cache and Persistent Storage Framework on top of [KryoNetty](https://github.com/Koboo/kryonetty). 

With NetCache objects can easily be cached and stored in the persistent sotrage. These are coded into strings using [Kryo](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo) & Base64 and written to the database. So far only the MySQL storage is stable. In the future, off-heap caching and client inbound caching will be added.
